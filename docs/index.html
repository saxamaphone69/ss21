        <p>Created by <b>saxamaphone</b> <span class="trip">!3.saxN0DHY</span>, who has been making userstyles for <a href="https://4chan.org">4chan</a> since 2009 with styles such as <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/23586/3-shades-of-4chan">3 Shades of 4chan</a> (which only exists as Midnight Caek in App/OneeChan now), <a href="https://github.com/saxamaphone69/curabitr">curabitr</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/saxamaphone69/xl">xl</a>.</p>
        <p><span class="code">ss16</span> is a fresh attempt to make a userstyle that looks radically different from the typical App/OneeChan aesthetic of today, utilising modern web standards and bleeding edge CSS technologies.</p>
        <p>First conceived in December 2015, <span class="code">ss16</span> has remained more-or-less the same. Updates are few and far between, only really being updated when new 4chan or 4chan X features are implemented.</p>

            <span class="feature--heading">Sidedish of Rice</span>
            <p>Unlike normal userstyles, <span class="code">ss16</span> requires a companion userscript for additional rice and features, not found in 4chan X or App/OneeChan.</p>
            <span class="feature--heading">Fully Featured</span>
            <p>While it does enforce some defaults, the latest version of 4chan X will always be supported (and required).</p>
            <span class="feature--heading">Filtered Fun</span>
            <p>Through the use of 4chan X&rsquo;s filtering feature, additional classes can be added to elements to further enhance <span class="code">ss16</span>.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature--grid-rcol">
            <span class="feature--heading">Web Fonts</span>
            <p><span class="code">ss16</span> uses <span class="code">@font-face</span> and <span class="code">@import</span> to load fonts such as Roboto, no longer needing you to download and install fonts locally, or use a Flash loader.</p>
            <span class="feature--heading">Sensible Defaults</span>
            <p><span class="code">ss16</span> utilises code from well-established web projects such as Bootstrap, H5BP, Normalize, and the Material Design Guidelines to ensure elements render consistently and correctly across browsers.</p>
            <span class="feature--heading">No <span class="code">!important;</span>s</span>
            <p>As it is meant to be a replacement CSS, <span class="code">ss16</span> requires users to block both 4chan&rsquo;s default CSS and 4chan X&rsquo;s (done with the userscript), resulting in cleaner code.</p>
            <span class="feature--heading">Material Icons</span>
            <p>All icons have been replaced from Font Awesome to Material Icons, and things that should be icons have been turned into them.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>It should be noted that <span class="code">ss16</span> <b class="underline">does not</b> function with either the default 4chan Extension or App/OneeChan. 4chan X must only be used.</p>
